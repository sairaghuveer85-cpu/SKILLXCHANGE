SkillXchange
SkillXchange is a college-exclusive digital collaboration platform designed to help students exchange skills, ask for academic or technical help, and collaborate on projects — all in one focused environment.

It brings together the useful aspects of platforms like LinkedIn, Discord, and social media, but is built specifically for a single college community and kept simple.
